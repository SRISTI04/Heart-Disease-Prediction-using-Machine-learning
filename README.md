# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-learning
This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based model to predict heart disease risk by analyzing patient data, including vital signs, medical history, and lifestyle factors. Using algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, and Decision Tree classifiers, the model aims to provide accurate, early detection to support healthcare providers in proactive patient care and preventive health strategies. The ultimate goal is to create an accessible, reliable tool that can improve diagnostic accuracy and contribute to better heart disease management.
